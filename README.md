[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful, yet simple source code editor made for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. This repository hosts Roar's implementation of VSCode. The VSCode on Roar is installed inside a [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/) container, and can be loaded using [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The container also comes with [spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) package managers preinstalled.

# Accessing and using VSCode on Roar
To use VSCode on Roar, you have two options:

* [Use the system-wide VSCode module (RHEL6 only)](#use-the-system-wide-vscode-module-rhel6-only)
* [Use a local module in your work directory (RHEL7 and RHEL6)](#use-a-local-module-in-your-work-directory-rhel7-and-rhel6)

### Use the system-wide VSCode module (RHEL6 only)
In order to access the system-wide VSCode module on Roar, you only need to use the following commands:

```bash
$ module use /gpfs/group/dml129/default/sw/modules
$ module load vscode/1.50.1
```

Now that you have loaded VSCode into your current environment you only need to use the following command in order to launch VSCode:

```bash
$ code
```

If there is an executable inside the VSCode container that you wish to use, simply use the following command:

```bash
$ code-exec <command> <options> <arguments>
```

**NOTE:** In order to have system-wide compatability, the VSCode container uses Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as the base. To have Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS as the base, you will need to install your own local module.

**Important:** Please note that the RHEL6 container will work both on RHEL7 and RHEL6, however, the RHEL7 container will only work on RHEL7.

### Use a local module in your work directory (RHEL7 and RHEL6)

  * [RHEL6 installation and access](#rhel6-installation-and-access)

#### RHEL7 installation and access
If you planning on using VSCode with RHEL7, use the following commands to install the RHEL7 variant of the VSCode container:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/ics-i-ask-center/vscode_roar/releases/download/v2.0/vscode_rhel7.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf vscode_rhe7.tar.gz
$ cd vscode_rhel7
$ bash setup.sh
```

The above commands will set up a module in `~/work/sw/modules`. To access your new VSCode module, you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ module use ~/work/sw/modules
$ module load vscode/1.51.1-local
```

Now, you only need to use the following command in order to launch VSCode:

```bash
$ code
```

And if there is an executable inside the VSCode container that you wish to use, simply use the following command:

```bash
$ code-exec <command> <options> <arguments>
```

#### RHEL6 installation and access
If you planning on using VSCode with RHEL6, use the following commands to install the RHEL6 variant of the VSCode container:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/ics-i-ask-center/vscode_roar/releases/download/v1.2/vscode_rhel6.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf vscode_rhel6.tar.gz
$ cd vscode_rhel6
$ bash setup.sh
```

The above commands will set up a module in `~/work/sw/modules`. To access your new VSCode module, you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ module use ~/work/sw/modules
$ module load vscode/1.50.1-rhel6-local
```

Now, you only need to use the following command in order to launch VSCode:

```bash
$ code
```

And if there is an executable inside the VSCode container that you wish to use, simply use the following command:

```bash
$ code-exec <command> <options> <arguments>
```

**Important:** Please note that the RHEL6 container will work both on RHEL7 and RHEL6, however, the RHEL7 container will only work on RHEL7.

# Bootstrapping
In order to use this container as the base for other singularity images (a.k.a bootstrap), then please use the one of the base definition files stored in `/bootstrap`. You can download the bootstrap definition files by either cloning this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NucciTheBoss/vscode_aci.git
```

and copying the files, or you can also download them using `wget`:

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NucciTheBoss/vscode_aci/master/bootstrap/vscode_library_bootstrap.def
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NucciTheBoss/vscode_aci/master/bootstrap/vscode_local_bootstrap.def
```

There are slight differences between the two bootstrap files. You should use `vscode_library_bootstrap.def` if you want to download the VSCode container from the Sylab Cloud before building your container. You should use `vscode_local_bootstrap.def` if you already have a copy of the container on your machine.

**Note:** If you are using the Sylabs Remote Builder to build your own container then you should use `vscode_library_bootstrap.def`.

# Custom Deployment
If you are looking for a custom deployment of VSCode (e.g. specific software, specialized environment, etc.), then please contact the ICDS i-ASK center at iask@ics.psu.edu for assistance. We can help you build the custom VSCode container you need.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using this vscode container then please open an issue, or contact Jason at the ICDS i-ASK center at either iask@ics.psu.edu or jcn23@psu.edu. Please contact the i-ASK center if you are looking for or need a custom deployment of this container.
